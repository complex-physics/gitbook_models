## Goals of this course

- bridge the gap between standard undergraduate CM course and frontier research
- introduction of topics, materials, and techniques that are commonly used in modern CMP
- basic understanding at the phenomenological level

1. share the colorfulness, beauty, and excitement of modern CMP
2. Foster free, independent, and critical thinking

## Features of this course

- focus on experimental aspects of CMP
- lots of real data and experimental observations
- some exposure to materials and experimental techniques
- mainly phenomenological and descriptional
- along the historical path of discovery and understanding
- not very systematic, not very accurate



## Condensed matter physics primer

- what is "condensed matter"?

> my definition: materials with particle density $\sim 10^{23} / cm ^{3}$

- where is the name "condensed matter" from?

> Philip Anderson and Volker Heine, in 1967 in Cambridge renamed "solid state theory group" to "condensed matter theory group"

- what do we study (mainly) in condensed matter physics?

>  the behavior of Electrons and Phonons

- How many condensed matter physicists are there?

> $1 / 3$ of all physicists, biggest branch of modern physics

- features of Experimental CMP

> a wide variety of topics, rapid progress, close interactions between theory, important driving force for cutting-edge technologies
